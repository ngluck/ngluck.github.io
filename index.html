								<b>Statement:</b><br>

								
								I am an astrophysicist and cosmologist, focusing on uncovering symmetries in the large-scale structures of our universe that exist 
								far beyond the outer limits of our solar system. My research is focused on computational astrophysics and cosmology, looking at the 
								evolution of the Halo-Gas-Galaxy Connection through both analytical models, N-body hydrodynamical simulations, and deep learning techniques.
								
							        <p>
								These symmetries are well represented on Earth through various forms of art and music, demonstrating the same mathematical principles that 
								govern the subjects ranging from atomic structures to galactic dynamics. My drawings typically depict people and are primarily created using 
								black ink, which allows very little margin for error. For me, portraits go beyond merely capturing accurate proportions and constructing precise 
								bone structures. They always carry a narrative, and in line with the tradition often found in physics textbooks, where exercises are 
								“left for the reader”, I conceal the story within the artwork for the viewer to discover.

    							<b>Modeling the Galaxy-Halo Connection:</b> Developing an AI-accelerated Galaxy-Halo model 
									for multiwavelength cosmological surveys using N-body simulations and semi-analytical 
									simulations modeling the evolution of the dark matter halos surrounding galaxies and other substructure.
									The aim is to obtain a computationally efficient, physically motivated model of the evolution of both baryonic
									and dark matter. This is done via JAX auto-differentiation methods, allowing for a fully differentiable model
									of the gas within dark matter halos, as an update to the original Baryon Pasting (BP) code. We also include dependencies on
									mass accretion history, concentration history, AGN feedback, and cosmology (via Abacus-Summit).

								<b>Machine Learning the Circum-Galactic Medium with CAMELS</b><br> The circum-galactic medium (CGM) can feasibly be mapped by 
								multiwavelength surveys covering broad swaths of the sky. With multiple large datasets becoming available in the near future, 
								we develop a likelihood-free Deep Learning technique using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to infer broad-scale physical 
								properties of a galaxy’s CGM and its halo mass for the first time. Using CAMELS (Cosmology and Astrophysics with MachinE Learning 
								Simulations) data, including IllustrisTNG, SIMBA, and Astrid models, we train CNNs on Soft X-ray and 21-cm (HI) radio 2D maps to 
								trace hot and cool gas, respectively, around galaxies, groups, and clusters. Our CNNs offer the unique ability to train and test on 
								“multifield” datasets comprised of both HI and X-ray maps, providing complementary information about physical CGM properties and 
								improved inferences. Applying eRASS:4 survey limits shows that X-ray is not powerful enough to infer individual halos with logarithmic masses 
								 less than 12.5. The multifield improves the inference for all halo masses. Generally, the CNN trained and tested on Astrid (SIMBA) can most 
								(least) accurately infer CGM properties. Cross-simulation analysis – training on one galaxy formation model and testing on another – highlights 
								the challenges of developing CNNs trained on a single model to marginalize over astrophysical uncertainties and perform robust 
								inferences on real data. The next crucial step in improving the resulting inferences on the physical properties of CGM depends on our ability 
								to interpret these deep-learning models. (See <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.07912.pdf">Gluck et al. 2023 </a> for additional details.)

								<b>Stony Brook University - Uncertainty Quantifications</b><br> This particular uncertainty quantifications study looks at how incertitude in the winds
								affect a 1 solar mass star and it's resulting white dwarf structure. I applied the publically available stellar evolution code, MESA (Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics)
								to run simulations through the SeaWulf cluster to explore the wind parameter space. Three test suites were run, each with a different
								statistical model: evenly spaces, Cauchy, and uniform random. Research objectives include studying and determining the boundaries of the 
								Reimers and Blocker wind parameters to see if the stellar evolution code completes with certain values, and to look at the final parameter values of the resulting white dwarf from each of the three test suites.

								<b>Technion Israel Institute of Technology - The Red Supergiant Problem</b><br>The Red Supergiant problem discusses the inconsistencies of observable supernovae, 
								as there is a gap between which progenitor stars lead to observable supernova explosions. Using MESA (Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics) I  
								simulated different progenitor stars of varying ZAMS (zero age main sequence) and wind and mass loss parameters. These mass loss parameters are key to understanding which stars will
								be obscured by dust by the time they explode as core collapse supernovae.
