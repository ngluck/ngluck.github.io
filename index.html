								<b>Condor Array Telescope</b><br>The Condor Array Telescope is an astronomical research telescope built, concieved, and managed by a small project team at Stony Brook University. 
								The Project is funded by the Advanced Technologies and Instrumentation Program of the National Science Foundation. This is a six telescope array located in the Rio Hurtado Valley of Chile each outfitted with large format CMOS cameras.
								<br><b>Reasearch Objectives:</b>
								<li>To study low-surface-brightness outer regions of the Milky Way, LMC, SMC, and other distant galaxies.</li>
								<li> Study transiting planets, gravitational microlensing events, and stars at a very rapid cadence of 60s.
