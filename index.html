								<b>Red Supergiant Problem</b><br>The Red Supergiant problem discusses the inconsistencies of observable supernovae, 
								as there is a gap between which progenitor stars lead to observable supernova explosions. Using MESA (Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics) I  
								simulated different progenitor stars of varying ZAMS and wind and mass loss parameters. These mass loss parameters are key to understanding which stars will
								be obscured by dust by the time they explode as core collapse supernovae.
								
								<br><b>Reasearch Conclusions:</b>
								<li>At around 18 solar masses, there is enough dust that is created during mass loss to obscure the supernova explosion.</li>
								<li>The mass loss mechanism found to be most probable is the jittering jets mechanism.
							
							</p>
							
							<p>
								<b>Uncertainty Quantifications</b><br> This particular uncertainty quantifications study looks at how incertitude in the winds
								affect a 1 solar mass star and it's resulting white dwarf structure. I applied the publically available stellar evolution code, MESA (Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics)
								to run simulations through the SeaWulf cluster to explore the wind parameter space. Three test suites were run, each with a different
								statistical model: evenly spaces, Cauchy, and uniform random.
								
								<br>Research Objectives:</br>
								<li>To study and determine the boundaries of the Reimers and Blocker wind parameters to see if the stellar evolution code completes with certain values.
								<li>To look at the final parameter values of the resulting white dwarf from each of the three test suites.
