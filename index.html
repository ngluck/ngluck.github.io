								<b>Research Interests:</b> Theoretical Astrophysics and Cosmology. Supernovae. Structure and Formation of the Universe. Machine and Deep Learning.

							<p> 
								Apart from my research, I lead a machine-learning working group with undergraduate, graduate, and faculty from universities around the world! We focus on how  
								to implement interpretablility within new or pre-existing astrophysical and cosmological problems. <br>

								I also have a physics-related website, called <a href="https://www.physicstrialanderror.com/">Trial and Error</a>,
								made for students from high school and beyond who are interested in the "how-to's" of academia, specifically within physics. I 
								had very little guidance on graduate applications, and I hope this will fill in those gaps for an aspiring researcher!

								<b>Fun Fact:</b> I speak English, Hebrew, Italian, some Mandarin, and am learning Russian and Romanian!

    							<b>Modeling the Halo-Gas-Galaxy Connection:</b> We are developing a computationally efficient, physically motivated model of the evolution of both baryonic
									and dark matter. This is done via JAX auto-differentiation methods, allowing for a fully differentiable model
									of the gas within dark matter halos, as an update to the original Baryon Pasting code. We also include dependencies on
									mass accretion history, concentration history, and AGN feedback. (Gluck et al. in prep)

								<b>Machine Learning the Circum-Galactic Medium with CAMELS</b><br> We develop a likelihood-free deep learning technique using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) 
								to infer broad-scale physical properties of a galaxy's circum-galactic medium (CGM) and halo mass from multiwavelength datasets. 
								Our CNNs, trained on CAMELS data, offer improved inferences by integrating both HI and X-ray maps, providing a novel approach 
								to mapping the CGM across different galaxy formation models. (See <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.07912.pdf">Gluck et al. 2023 </a> for additional details.)

								<b>Stony Brook University - Uncertainty Quantifications</b><br> This particular uncertainty quantifications study looks at how incertitude in the winds
								affect a 1 solar mass star and it's resulting white dwarf structure. I applied the publically available stellar evolution code, MESA (Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics)
								to run simulations through the SeaWulf cluster to explore the wind parameter space. Three test suites were run, each with a different
								statistical model: evenly spaces, Cauchy, and uniform random. Research objectives include studying and determining the boundaries of the 
								Reimers and Blocker wind parameters to see if the stellar evolution code completes with certain values, and to look at the final parameter values of the resulting white dwarf from each of the three test suites.

								<b>Technion Israel Institute of Technology - The Red Supergiant Problem</b><br>The Red Supergiant problem discusses the inconsistencies of observable supernovae, 
								as there is a gap between which progenitor stars lead to observable supernova explosions. Using MESA (Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics) I  
								simulated different progenitor stars of varying ZAMS (zero age main sequence) and wind and mass loss parameters. These mass loss parameters are key to understanding which stars will
								be obscured by dust by the time they explode as core collapse supernovae. (See <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/494/4/5230/5823752">Gofman, Gluck, and Soker 2020 </a> for additional details.)
